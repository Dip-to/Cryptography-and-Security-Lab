Bangladesh, a country nestled in South Asia, is a tapestry woven with a myriad of historical, cultural, 
and geographical threads. With a population exceeding 160 million, it's one of the most densely populated 
nations globally. The nation shares borders with India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the southeast,
and boasts a southern coastline along the Bay of Bengal. Dhaka, the bustling capital, is the epicenter of 
politics, commerce, and culture. The nation's journey is steeped in a rich historical tapestry, tracing back
to ancient civilizations like the Vanga and the Maurya Empire. However, its contemporary identity was forged
through the crucible of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, when it emerged as an independent country 
following a protracted struggle against Pakistani rule.
